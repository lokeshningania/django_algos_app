            <h1 >Backtracking Algorithms</h1>
            <p class="description">Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.</p>

            <h1 >Geometrical Algorithms</h1>
            <p class="description">These algorithms are designed to solve Geometric Problems. They requires in-depth knowledge of different mathematical subjects like combinatorics, topology, algebra, differential geometry etc.</p>

            <h1 >Bit Algorithms</h1>
            <p class="description">The Bitwise Algorithms are used to perform operations at bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways. The bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are some times used to improve the efficiency of a program. For example: To check if a number is even or odd !</p>

            <h1 >Branch & Bound</h1>
            <p class="description">A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set !</p>

            <h1 >Randomised Algorithms</h1>
            <p class="description">A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic. ... In common practice, randomized algorithms are approximated using a pseudorandom number generator in place of a true source of random bits; such an implementation may deviate from the expected theoretical behavior.</p>
