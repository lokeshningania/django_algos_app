            <h1 >Arrays</h1>
            <p class="description">An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).</p>

            <h1 >Linked Lists</h1>
            <p class="description">In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.</p>

            <h1 >Heap</h1>
            <p class="description">A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key of P is greater than or equal to the key of C</p>

        <a class="cards links" href="/hashes/">
            <h1 >Hash Tables</h1>
            <p class="description">A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.</p>

        <a class="cards links" href="/stack/">
            <h1 >Stacks</h1>
            <p class="description">Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen.</p>

        <a class="cards links" href="/queues/">
            <h1 >Queues</h1>
            <p class="description">In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.</p>

        <a class="cards links" href="/graphs/">
            <h1 >Graphs</h1>
            <p class="description"> In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics. A graph data structure consists of a finite set of vertices, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.</p>

        <a class="cards links" href="/trees/">
            <h1 >Trees</h1>
            <p class="description">In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes</p>
